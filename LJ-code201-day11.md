  #Today I learned...
  Motivation and goals are an important part of adult learning; so is adapting to and gaining insight from things you did not anticipate. What would you say is the most unexpected part of this experience, and how have you learned from it?
The most unexpected part about the coding experience would have to be how difficult it would be. I'm someone who generally excels in school and classes without much effort, so to have to be in a setting where the material is challenging and there is no "one correct answer", it was a shock for me. Additionally, trying to balance work and school was incredibly difficult. I felt I had no time for myself and had to be much more disciplined in my lifestyle. Working at a tech industry for so long, you get so relaxed in waking up whenever you want and going into work whenever you want. Through code fellows i learned how to restructure my life so that I am able to get more work done and be more efficient with what little time I had.
