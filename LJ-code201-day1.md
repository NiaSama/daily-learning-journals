# LJ Code 201 - Day 1
#Today I learned...
Today I learned more about the DOM. DOM stands for Document Object Model. We can use the DOM when we interact with web pages. Which means we can add content to a HTML document, delete from an HTML document, and change content in the HTML document. You can visualize the DOM as a tree where it shows the hierchy of the code. The DOM tree is made up of nodes. Nodes can be elements, text within elements, and HTML attributes. 

I really like this video to break down the DOM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H63dVFDuJDM
