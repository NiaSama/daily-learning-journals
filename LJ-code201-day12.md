Recently I learned...
Recently I learned how important it is to not be a perfectionist. When trying to catch all of your mistakes as you are doing your work, it becomes difficult to get anything actually done. I've been trying to practice to just do the assignment, project, etc, and then refine later. It is still difficult but it's nice to know that there are steps to take to getting things done instead of feeling like you can't complete anything.Â
