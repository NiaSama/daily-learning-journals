How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning?

- In terms of of this course, I don't really see myself planning anything because I am following a curriculum that was planned by my instructor. But I do evaluate my learning by seeing if I understand what is being taught to me and if I don't understand it, I wont on understanding it. 

What details will you  record and/or measure?

I like to record/measure my knowledge by writing down the concept I just learned and put it into my own words. I feel like if I can "rewrite the concept" in my own terms, then I have a pretty solid grasp on what the material is. 

How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?

I will evaluate what I want to learn when I come across something that interests me or if I come across an obstacle that is in the way of my goal. I usually don't know what is valuable to learn until I hit a wall where I can no longer move forward unless I learn it.
